Important Instruction to run code 

1) Go to the directory containing the main.cpp file.
2) Type following command
   g++ main.cpp -o executable
   ./executable filename experimentNo.
   
Note that :-
1) If you want to change the input filename then you have to change the filename in codeItself only , command line is independent of it.

2) If you want to change the input data run the input.cpp file , it will change the input data according to time. 

Output format :

:- Every time when code runs it has creating a decision tree so that experiment 3 and experiment 4 can prune that tree and add noise in that tree only.

For experiment 2 :
For restrict height , training and test accuracy are shown 
and after that split count of attribute

For experiment 3 :
With given noise training and test accuracy is shown.

For experiment 4 :
Original tree characters and pruning tree such as its root index , height , number of nodes , accuracy on test data is shown.

For experiment 5 :
Output foramt is 
Number of trees   training accuracy test ACCURACY
